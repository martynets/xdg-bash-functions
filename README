This directory contains the xdg-bash-functions version 1.0.

The xdg-bash-functions is the set of bash shell functions designed in
accordance with freedesktop.org specifications with the goal to be desktop 
independent and don't rely on any desktop specific configuration managers.
These functions process system wide and user specific configuration files to
get requested information. But they do not provide functionality to alter any
of the configuration files.

Current version consists of two sets of functions:
    - set of icon functions (icon-functions file) - returns fully qualified file
        name of icon file for requested icon from user selected icon theme.
    - set of MIME functions (mime-functions file) - returns user preferred or
        the best found viewer command for files of requested MIME type. It also
        sources and calls icon-functions to get icon for the given MIME type.

As processing of many configuration files can be time consuming this set of
functions caches the information that have been read to minimize disk operations
and speed up subsequent calls. Also there is functionality to commit internal
cache to a file and reuse it on next run.

Specifications
--------------

The package is based on the following freedesktop.org specifications:
    Icon Theme Specification version 0.11
    Icon Naming Specification version 0.8.90
    Shared MIME-info Database specification version 0.20
    Association between MIME types and applications version 1.0
    Desktop Entry Specification versions 0.9.5 and 1.1
Plus mailcap file format (Appendix A of RFC 1524).

Software Requirements
---------------------

This package uses bash specific extensions and requires bash shell version 4+.

Additionally it may call a couple external tools and thus depends on the
following packages:
    coreutils - mkdir tool is called to create cache files subdirectory tree if
        it doesn't exist. This directory tree is customizable and defaults to
        $HOME/.cache/ which most likely already exists on your system.
    procps - ps tool is used only in case if lxsession is running (LXDE's 
        Xsettings manager) to try to get user preferred icon theme. If that is
        not successful GTK+ settings are checked next.

MIME functions might generate final viewing command for requested MIME type and
the result could refer to tools from the following packages:
    coreutils - cat tool is used in cases when viewing command expects content
        of the input file on its stdin.
    xterm - lxterm tool is used in cases when the viewing command needs a
        terminal. This is customizable value and can be replaced with user
        preferred terminal.
    less - less tool is used in cases when the viewing command generates copious
        output. This is customizable value and can be replaced with user
        preferred pager.

MIME functions process configuration files maintained by the following optional
packages:
    various XDG compliant implementations (DE's, file managers, etc.) -
        mimeapps.list files - user preferred application lists;
    desktop-file-utils - update-desktop-database tool maintains mimeinfo.cache
        files;
    mime-support - update-mime tool maintains mailcap files.

Icon functions may read configuration files of the following optional packages:
    lxsession;
    GTK+ 2.x;
    GTK+ 3.x;
    various icon themes.

Installation
------------

This package does not require any kind of installation. The files can be copied 
to any convenient location. But note that icon-functions file is sourced by
mime-functions and both of them must be located in the same directory.

Icon Functions Usage
--------------------

The icon-functions file can be sourced by a script which needs to resolve an
icon name to the fully qualified icon file name from the user selected icon
theme. Current version of the package supports MimeTypes, Applications and
Places contexts.

The icon_functions_init function must be called first to initialize internal
variables. It expects single mandatory argument which forces to regenerate
values of internal variables (true) or to try to restore them from the cache
file (any other value). The main purpose of this argument is to inform the init
function that some settings have been changed and the values stored in the cache
file are no longe valid ones. This makes sense if the main script maintains some
configuration file and the last one (or the script itself) is newer then the
cache file which name is stored in ICONCACHEFILE variable. The function returns
success if internal variables were initialized from scratch or failure if values
of the variables were restored from the cache file. Once the function
regenerates values of internal variables they are immediately flushed to the
cache file.

The find_mime_icon, find_apps_icon and find_places_icon functions can be called
to resolve an icon name to the fully qualified icon file name in their
respective contexts. Each of these functions receives single mandatory argument
- the icon name. If the icon file found its fully qualified name is assigned to
ICON variable and the functions return success. Othewise the functions return
failure.

The find_icon_for_mime_type function extends find_mime_icon function
functionality. It receives MIME type as the argument, tries standard name for
the given type, looks through mappings from MIME types to icons and generic
icons in the MIME database and tries them, tries generic icon names for given
type, tries suggestions made by MIME functions (if any) given as possible
application icon name set in ICON variable and/or taken as executable name from
EXEC variable and, as the last resort, it tries "application-x-executable"
default icon name. The function returns success if the icon file found and ICON
variable contains its name. Otherwise it returns failure.

Example script for icon functions and its possible output in comments:

#! /bin/bash
. "${0%/*}/icon-functions"
icon_functions_init true

find_apps_icon libreoffice-calc && echo "$ICON"
    # /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/libreoffice-calc.png

find_places_icon folder && echo "$ICON"
    # /usr/share/icons/lubuntu/places/48/folder.svg

find_icon_for_mime_type application/vnd.ms-powerpoint && echo "$ICON"
    # /usr/share/icons/lubuntu/mimes/48/x-office-presentation.svg

ICON=geany
find_icon_for_mime_type test/x-type && echo "$ICON"
    # /usr/share/pixmaps/geany.xpm

ICON=non-existent-name
EXEC="gimp %s"
find_icon_for_mime_type test/x-type && echo "$ICON"
    # /usr/share/icons/lubuntu/apps/48/gimp.svg

exit 0

MIME Functions Usage
--------------------

The mime-functions file can be sourced by a script which needs to get the
viewing command for a file of the given MIME type. MIME functions source icon
functions and call them to setup the icon file name to present the given MIME
type also.

The mime_functions_init function must be called first to initialize internal
variables. It expects single mandatory argument which indicates to drop data
collected in the cache file during previous runs and start from scratch (true)
or to load them (any other value). The purpose of this argument is absolutely
the same as in the case of icon functions init function described above when the
name of the cache file is stored in MIMECACHEFILE variable. The function returns
success if the data were initialized from scratch or failure if data collected
during previous runs were loaded from the cache file.

The function save_mime_cache can be called to flush collected data to the cache
file. These data will be reused at next run and this will speed up the script
during subsequent calls. Call to this function should be made preferably at the
end of the main script. The function does not receive any arguments and does not
return any specific values.

Core functionality of this module is provided by find_command_for_type function.
It receives one mandatory argument - MIME type/subtype and finds the viewing
command for a file of the given MIME type and the icon to represent it. The
function tries to get necessary information from the desktop file of the viewing
application which is expected to be listed in either mimeapps.list or
mimeinfo.cache files. If not it falls back to mailcap files. The latter can be
disabled by optional flag - any value passed to the function as the second
argument. If the function finds the viewing application it returns success,
otherwise failure. On success it sets EXEC and optionally ICON and NAME
variables. The EXEC variable contains the viewing command where %s field
represents position of the target file name. The field is always unquoted and
must be replaced with quoted file name. The ICON and NAME variables are
optionally set with values from corresponding fields in the desktop file if such
one was read and such fields are present in it. Otherwise these variables remain
intact. If set they contain the icon name of the application and its name
respectively.

The get_command_for_type function extends the above one. It receives the same
argument and tries to get the same information from the cache. The function
maintains cache for MIME types, their respective viewer commands and icons. In
case when no entry found for the requested MIME type it calls two functions:
find_command_for_type to find the viewer command and find_icon_for_mime_type
from icon functions to find fully qualified icon file name. If still nothing
found it falls back to the system file manager command and default icon. Thus it
always returns success and sets EXEC and ICON variables.

Example script for MIME functions - prints info for files in working directory:

#! /bin/bash
. "${0%/*}/mime-functions"              # Source xdg-bash-functions
mime_functions_init true                # Initialize xdg-bash-functions

shopt -qs nullglob
declare -a BROWSINGDIR
mapfile -t BROWSINGDIR < <(file --separator $'\n' --dereference --no-pad --mime-type * 2>/dev/null)

for (( i=0; i<${#BROWSINGDIR[*]}; i+=2))
do
    file=${BROWSINGDIR[i]}
    type=${BROWSINGDIR[((i+1))]:1}      # Truncate leading space
    if [ "$type" != "inode/directory" ]
    then
        get_command_for_type "$type"    # Get viewing command and icon file
        EXEC=${EXEC//"%s"/"\"$file\""}  # Replace %s field with quoted file name
        echo "File: $file"
        echo "MIME type: $type"
        echo "View command: $EXEC"
        echo "Icon file: $ICON"
        echo
    fi
done

save_mime_cache                         # Flush cached info to disk file

exit 0

Output of the above script might look the following:

File: COPYING
MIME type: text/x-pascal
View command: geany "COPYING"
Icon file: /usr/share/icons/lubuntu/mimes/48/text-x-generic.svg

File: icon-functions
MIME type: text/x-shellscript
View command:  geany "icon-functions"
Icon file: /usr/share/icons/lubuntu/mimes/48/text-x-script.svg

File: mime-functions
MIME type: text/x-shellscript
View command:  geany "mime-functions"
Icon file: /usr/share/icons/lubuntu/mimes/48/text-x-script.svg

File: README
MIME type: text/plain
View command: leafpad "README"
Icon file: /usr/share/icons/lubuntu/mimes/48/text-plain.svg

Configuration
-------------

Both MIME functions and icon functions have user customizable variables which
define defaults and preferences. They all are listed at top of each file,
highlighted as a section, supplied with comments and their names are pretty
self-explanatory.

These values may be changed by the main script somewhere between sourcing of the
functions file and call to the init function. The result is unpredictable if any
of the variables are changed after the init function call. Also, please, pay
your attention that some variables are refered to in values of another ones. If
you change the first one don't forget to redefine the last one as well.

It is good idea to put all user customizable variables in a separate
configuration file and source it. Note that the init function must be informed
that the configuration file and/or the main script itself are newer then the
cache files. This will ensure that data from the cache files which may be no
longer actual are not used.

The above example script can be extended with the following lines to maintain
the configuration file:

#! /bin/bash
. "${0%/*}/mime-functions"          # Source xdg-bash-functions

# Source config file before mime_functions_init call
[ -r "${0%/*}/example.conf" ] && . "${0%/*}/example.conf"

DROP_CACHE="true"
[ "${0%/*}/example.conf" -ot "$MIMECACHEFILE" ] &&\
    [ "${0%/*}/example.conf" -ot "$ICONCACHEFILE" ] &&\
        DROP_CACHE="false"

mime_functions_init $DROP_CACHE     # Initialize xdg-bash-functions

The following is the full list of customizable variables and can be used as the
configuration file:
